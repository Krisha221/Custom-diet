The project proposed is a customized health nutrition website according to user preferences. An increasing number of people have come to recognize the importance of maintaining a strong immune system through healthy eating habits. However, for those who lack knowledge about nutrition or have limited financial means, making informed dietary choices can be a challenge. As a potential solution to this issue, the project proposed is development of a website or mobile app that provides customized healthy eating plans based on users' budgets and dietary preferences, including any restrictions they may have. The aim is to offer personalized diet plans that cater to users' nutritional needs, promoting a healthy lifestyle and boosting immunity. Users will have the ability to download and share their customized plans, and while general plans will be accessible without login, those seeking personalized plans will need to create an account.
